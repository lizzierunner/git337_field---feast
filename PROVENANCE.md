# Provenance & Authorship — Field & Feast  
**Author:** Elizabeth Johnson  
**Course:** GIT 337  

## 🧩 Original Work
All of the following were created entirely by me (Elizabeth Johnson):
- Full HTML structure for the Field & Feast site  
- All CSS styling, including:
  - Mobile-first layout  
  - Responsive breakpoints  
  - Rebuilt grid systems (offerings-grid & gallery-grid)  
  - Updated navigation + typography + spacing  
- Gallery layout, responsive design decisions, and card styling  
- All mockups and design decisions  
- Written text, hierarchy, and alt text  
- Favicon handling and debugging  

## 🖼 Assets
- Images in `/images` are either:  
  • Photos I selected from royalty-free sources, or  
  • Provided assets from the assignment  
- Mockups in `/mockups` were created and exported by me.  
- Duplicate mockups were removed during cleanup (Nov 23).  

(If any image needs attribution, list it here:  
**Example:** “Hero image — Unsplash / Photographer Name / License”)

## ⚙️ Tools & AI Usage
- Built in **VS Code** with GitHub version control  
- Used GitHub Desktop for merging, pushing, conflict resolution  
- **No AI tools generated code or written content.**  
- Any debugging assistance (e.g., explaining 404 errors, merge conflicts, or Git behavior) was reviewed and implemented manually by me.
