# Provenance & Authorship — Field & Feast  
**Author:** Elizabeth Johnson  
**Course:** GIT 337  

## 🧩 Original Work
All of the following were created entirely by me:
- HTML structure
- CSS styling (mobile-first, responsive, spacing)
- Gallery layout and interactions
- Mockups and design decisions
- All written copy and alt text

## 🖼 Assets
- Images in `/images` are either:  
  • Photos I selected from royalty-free sources, or  
  • Provided assets for the assignment  
- Mockups in `/mockups` were designed by me.

(If any image needs attribution, list it here:  
**Example:** “Image 3 — Unsplash / Photographer Name / License”)

## ⚙️ Tools & AI Usage
- I used VS Code and GitHub for development.  
- **No AI tools were used to generate the code or written content.**  
- Any automated suggestions (like spellcheckers or linters) were manually reviewed and edited by me.
