# 🌾 Field & Feast — GIT 337  
**Author:** Elizabeth Johnson  

Field & Feast is a mobile-first, responsive website designed and developed for GIT 337.  
I built this project from my own wireframes and mockups, focusing on clean structure, semantic HTML, organized CSS, and a scalable grid-based layout. All visual design decisions, gallery formatting, content choices, and responsiveness were created entirely by me.
