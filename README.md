# Field & Feast — GIT 337  
**Author:** Elizabeth Johnson  

This project was built from my own wireframes and mockups for GIT 337.  
All layout, structure, HTML, CSS, and gallery work was created by me.

## 📌 What I Built
- Mobile-first site structure  
- Custom CSS grid and spacing system  
- Image gallery section  
- My own alt text, page copy, and image selection  
- Mockups and visual design decisions

## 🛠 How I Built It (Process)
- Nov 10–11: Created wireframes and exported mockups (see `/mockups` folder)  
- Nov 12: Built initial HTML and mobile CSS  
- Nov 13: Added gallery section + responsive layout  
- Nov 14: Accessibility pass + final content polish  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- VS Code  
- Git + GitHub  
- No AI-generated code or AI-written copy was used.  
- Any suggestions I reviewed (such as spelling/formatting tools) were manually edited by me.
